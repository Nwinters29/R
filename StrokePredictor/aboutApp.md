#### About this Stroke Predictor

This app calculates a patient's liklihood of being at risk of a stroke by utilizing a random forest classification model. The full end-to-end creation of this model can be veiwed on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Nwinters29/StrokePredictor). 

**Note:**

The data used to train this model was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godfatherfigure/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data) and was not cited as being from actual patients. Until proven otherwise, consider the data to be from fictional patients for the purpose of educational use. Given this, the app's output for stroke risk should not be taken as an absolute.
