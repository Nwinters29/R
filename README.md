+ Data visualization
+ Time series analysis
+ Clustering
+ Model building and evaluation
+ Data prediction with a ML model

## Magazine Cluster Analysis
How can a magazine company effectively target key demographics? This business question is what led this cluster analysis on magazine subscriber data. The data genrated from this analysis could help the aforementioned magazine company better advertise to specific groups or even include more articles that are better suited to specific demographics and their needs.

Includes:
+ Rmd file detailing the whole cluster analysis
+ csv file of the raw data (obtained from the Eastern University course "Data Science for Buisness)

**Full interactive notebook can be seen on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Nwinters29/MagazineClusterAnalysis)**

## Stroke Predictor
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the stroke risk of a patient based on data relating to a patients medical history and demographics. This project could aid healthcare professionals in allocating the proper need and care to patients who may be at a higher risk of stroke.

Includes:
+ R file of the ML project
+ R file of an RShiny app for model deployment
+ md file for app description
+ Rmd file detailing the whole end-to-end ML project
+ 2 csv files of the data at varying steps in the ML project (raw data was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godfatherfigure/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data))
+ rds file of the final model

**Full interactive web app can be seen on [shinyapps.io](https://nwinters.shinyapps.io/app_strokePredictor/)**

## Time Series Analysis
This project aims to utilize various types of regression to forecast future values in a time series analysis relating to Starbuck's revenue, New York Times' revenue, Whole Foods revenue, and LinkedIn memberships. 

Includes:
+ Rmd file detailing the whole analysis
+ 4 csv files of the raw data (obtained from the Eastern University course "Data Science for Buisness)
