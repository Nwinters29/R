## Stroke Predictor
This is an end-to-end machine learning project that aims to predict the stroke risk of a patient based on data relating to a patients medical history and demographics. This project could aid healthcare professionals in allocating the proper need and care to patients who may be at a higher risk of stroke.

Includes:
+ R file of the ML project
+ Rmd file detailing the whole end-to-end ML project
+ 2 csv files of the data at varying steps in the ML project (raw data was obtained from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/godfatherfigure/healthcare-dataset-stroke-data))
+ rds file of the final model

**Full interactive notebook can be seen on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/Nwinters29/StrokePredictor)**
